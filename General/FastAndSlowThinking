Defining Fast and Slow Thinking

	- Lots to learn, need to figure out how to optimize fast and slow thinking, especially for specific problem sets.

## Slow Thinking
- Takes more energy, so more tiring
- Is more accurate
- Too much slow thinking --> paralysis analysis
- When to use
 - A task is performed when the brain consciously/unconsciously decides that the plan for this task,
   given the current circumstances, is acceptable.
 - Use when `risk of error with fast thinking` > `acceptable threshold | current circumstances`

## Fast Thinking
- Letting instinct taken over, which is just naturalized slow thinking
- Fast Thinking for tasks can be built by repetitively practicing slow thinking
- When to use
 - Use when `risk of error with fast thinking` < `acceptable threshold | current circumstances`
 - Ok with figuring out the issue on the fly
- Think of examples...
 - Football

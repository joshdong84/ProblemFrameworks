<title> Creating a Solution</title>
Everything can be viewed as having a solution (not every solution is what you desire). You are trying to turn your
deduction into induction via an alignment of foundations and abstract thoughts.

Here is a structured process that can be used to intelligently and efficiently create a solution.
- This applies only to logical solutions. When logic must be thrown out the window. This is of limited use.*

<h1 style=color:LightGreen>1. Lay out the foundations for Deduction and Induction</h1>
First, understand what you are working with and where you want to go. Lay out what you can deduce and induce from.
1. Read and note down what you are trying to create
2. Establish your inputs and outputs.
    1. Treat your creation like a black box with inputs and outputs. This black box is the solution you are trying to
    create. Your goal is to understand the intricacies of the black box such that you can create it.
3. Establish the constants of the black box.
4. Establish the variables of the black box.
5. Establish how to/what would confirm the creation of the solution (the test cases).

<h2>Ensuring the Complete Coverage of Your Solution</h2>
Use sets to help you cover all possible inputs (and potential outputs). Using the rules of logic, you can
define complete sets and partial sets.

Based on the first 5 steps, you should now be able to build suggestions to get solutions.
Remember to begin by answering the question. Your suggestion must be guided towards a solution, otherwise it is merely
mental exercise.
1. Generate Suggestions from What you Know, Reupdate the layer of induction and deduction that you have.
2. Keep repeating previous steps until Induction = Deduction.

    - Logic behind this
        1. You only know what you know. So, first try to see if you can break down the solution into solutions
        you can already create ***(TOP DOWN METHOD).*** Continue to break down solutions until you have
        simplified them into things you know. Or build your foundations until you can build them into what yoiu want
        ***(BOTTOM-UP METHOD)***


    - Tips for Creating Suggestions for Solution
        Here are some tricks to help you create solutions
        - **Start by defining a brute force solution. That establishes a good baseline to work off of.**
        - _**Utilize formulas and previous solutions.**_
            - For example, given the solution of 1 + 1 = 2, and the concept of multiplication
            $$ 2 * 2 = 2 + 2 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4 $$
        - _**Reframe the black box.**_ Remember that every solution you have built in your life
        follows the same thought process. All you have to do is transpose one solution to another.
        Your experience in cooking can help you solve your experience in building a skyscraper.
        - **Unprime Yourself** - Sometimes it is good to reset your brain so it can see thinbgs in adifferent light.
        - _**Trust your gut.**_ You’ve created so many solutions. Trust in your mind.
        Give yourself some free reign to figure it out. Extrapolate from what you know.
        Try something out of left field. Some solutions haven’t been created yet and require creativity.
        Sometimes you have to take a leap of faith and try something new and fresh. This applies to creating art,
        working on groundbreaking technologies, etc.

    - What if I'm stuck?
	    - If you're stuck, you must identify why. If you have exhausted all downward paths, it may be time to
	     work your way back up from the bottom (induction).
	    - Un-Priming Algorithm: Identify your biases and shed them if needed. Mentally transport yourself to a
	    new room and start anew. This helps you move without biases, which may stop you from moving forward.

This is simple, you have it all planned out. Go create it.
